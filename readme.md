# PupperCoin-Crowdsale by John Mangahas

The starter code creates an ERC20 token that will be minted through a Crowdsale contract using the OpenZeppelin Solidity Library. The Crowdsale contract will execute the entire process, allowing the developer to send ETH in exchange for PUP (PupperCoin). This contract main function is to mint tokens and transact with buyers. The Crowdsale contract will also allow transactions to be refunded once the crowdfunding goal has been met. The Crowdsale contract will deploy three smart contracts: PupperCoin, PupperCoinSaleDeployer, and PupperCoinSale. The following contracts have been deployed using Ropsten Test Network. 

* test_wallet_address: 0xbEC0d63779f5d59346a135cCf681bFa5B13d61C8
* token_address: 0x5C89033b300581C3E728301Cf8f76213183BE9B1
* token_sale_address: 0x400bD04451Cfcd513aCb25cf8CfE10101829ca6d
